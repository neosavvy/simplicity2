This migration will also take the software off individual computers and allow it to be run as a web-based system for much easier maintenance and support in addition to the convenience of running the software from anywhere an internet connection is available.  The vendor who supports this software, VSI, will be onsite to assist.  RecTrac will be unavailable all day on Monday, July 11th.  If the migration is completed on Monday, Parkâ€™s staff will start using the new 3.1 version on Tuesday. *** On Tuesday, July 12, Christen notified RecTrac users the following:  Nick and Ryan are here from Vermont Systems working on the RecTrac upgrade this week.  The main database has been migrated, and the Nature Center will be wrapped up this morning.  They will be going around from site to site working with your main staff to make sure the new software is operational, and that you can do your daily tasks.  They will be headed to the Nature Center, Aston and the Pools today, and if there is time they will visit Centers and offices.  We will give you a call beforehand, but please try to be as flexible as you can.  Please wait to use RecTrac until they visit your site.  If this is a problem please contact the Help Desk.",

The running virtual machines began starting up on COA-HYPERV-1 as part of the disaster recovery process.  While this was going on, they restarted COA-HYPERV-3 around 10:45 a.m. and checked all connectivity which was fine.  During the restart all four Maximo servers and HR Track plus Exchange and the old FPserver had finished restarting on COA-HYPERV-1.  The only one left was COA-CASHUB.  They proceeded to shut down and migrate all the VMs back to COA-HYPERV-3.   By 11:05 email was back up and the rest of the VMs were up about 15 minutes later.

This will better organize cabling to improve system reliability. Work is expected to be complete by 3:00pm the same day. - White Fawn Tower serves the central business district. Radio towers in the south, west, and north districts will continue operating throughout the day. Radio service from the White Fawn tower will go offline periodically during the service window. Other towers will pick of the service load, and no special measures should be required of radio users in the field. - While this maintenance work is expected to have minimal impact to radio service, in-building coverage in the central business district may be impaired slightly while White Fawn tower is offline. - Please be sure to share this notification with any affected staff. Questions or concerns about this scheduled maintenance may be directed to Jeff Reble. Any technical issues can be reported to the IT Services Help Desk at x4000 or help@ashevillenc.gov.",

Moving Cisco infrastructure hardware that supports both the Municipal Building VPN and the firewall connection to Buncombe County from Municipal Building Room 409, in the hallway, to the radio room off Communications 4th floor.  This will be a first phase in establishing redundant connectivity to Buncombe County over newer and faster hardware.  The move of the main City to County firewall is anticipated to take about 30-45 minutes.  This will result in a complete disconnection of all public safety applications, citywide.  The move of the VPN firewall involves some reconfiguration and may take an additional 45 minutes to complete.  This move will cause a VPN disconnection, but vehicles should reconnect to the City Hall backup VPN server and continue to function.  We will contact Communications and APD/AFR command staff before beginning the maintenance window, to ensure no major public safety events are underway.",

The maintenance will not affect Internet access for Patrol MDTs or other City public safety facilities.  Although ERC Broadband expects the service outage to last less than 30 minutes, they have reserved the full six-hour window in case they encounter unexpected issues.",
